    "PROBLEM 2: PAYING DEBT OFF IN A YEAR  (15 points possible)\n",

    "Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative using this payment scheme, which is okay. A summary of the required math is found below:\n",
